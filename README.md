## Introdution
This project is edit from [opencv-facial-landmark-detection](https://learnopencv.com/facemark-facial-landmark-detection-using-opencv/), but we change the **Facemark** model from opencv to dlib.
And we use the face landmark to detect the 4 of driver behaviors, including **yawn**, **distraction**, **lower head**, and **closing eyes**.
## requisites
[dlib](http://dlib.net/) 19.24
